/*Group 1:
Objective:
	1. Display a satellite image (multi and hyperspectral)
	2. Plot spectral profile at a given location
	3. Extract band(s) from the given image and store the  spectral subset as new image
Library to be used:
			1. GDAL for image operations
			2. JAI for image display
			3. JFreeChart for plotting(http://JFree.org) */
