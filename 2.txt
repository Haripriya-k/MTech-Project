/*Group 2:
Objective:
	1. Display a DEM 
	2. Plot Elevation profile along a given path
	3. Extract band(s) from the given image and store the  spectral subset as new image
Library to be used:
			1. GDAL/OGR for image and vector operations
			2. JAI for image display
			3. JFreeChart for plotting(http://JFreeChart.org) */

	{
	*/read the DEM as user input
	calculate slope aspect 
	store values in corresponding variables viz. slope, aspect and elev*/
